🔗 [https://share.kevintobler.ch](https://share.kevintobler.ch)

---

## 🔧 Installation

1. Upload all files to your web server
2. Open the application in your browser
3. Access `/admin.php` to create your admin credentials
4. Choose your desired configuration values in the **Admin Panel**
5. When `send_email` is set to active, make shure to define the `SMTP server`, `SMTP port`, `SMTP username`, and `SMTP password` in the **Admin Panel**

> ⚠️ Requires PHP 7.4 or higher. No database needed.

---

## 🧭 Admin Panel

The **Admin Panel** provides a secure management interface for your **Dropzone File Sharing** installation.

### 🔐 Login & Setup Admin Panel
- First-time access via `/admin.php` triggers **Admin Setup** (username + password creation)
- Credentials are stored securely (hashed) in `.admin.json` and secured with `.htaccess`
- After setup, login via the **Admin Login** form in `/admin.php`
- Setup your desired configuration values and when `send_email` is set to active, make shure to define the `SMTP server`, `SMTP port`, `SMTP username`, and `SMTP password`

---

## 🌍 Language Support

Default language is German `?lang=de`. Use `?lang=en` to switch to English, `?lang=fr` to switch to French, `?lang=it` to switch to Italian or click on the flag:

```
https://example.com/index.php?lang=de
https://example.com/index.php?lang=en
https://example.com/index.php?lang=fr
https://example.com/index.php?lang=it
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure the following options in the **Admin Panel**:

- Choose default language (e.g. 'de', 'en', 'fr' or 'it')
- Set the timezone according to your preference
- Control link expiration options
- Enable/Disable `only_upload` mode without generating a link
- Enable/Disable `send_email` mode (⚠️ make sure to define the `SMTP server`, `SMTP port`, `SMTP username`, and `SMTP password`).
- Enable/Disable `pwzip` mode for password protection of the zip file itself. If deactivated, only the download is password-protected, not the ZIP file (⚠️ ZIP password cannot be modified).

---

## 🔒 Security

- Each upload can be protected with a custom password  
- Option to allow only a **single download** or multiple downloads  
- Files are automatically deleted after the expiration time
- Passwords are **never stored in plain text**

---

## 📁 Folder Uploads & ZIP

When uploading a folder, the tool detects it and automatically creates a ZIP file from its contents to simplify sharing.
